Dependencies:

1. npm i sass --save-dev
2. npm i react-router-dom
3. npm i firebase


1. For userAuth if Firebase 9.0+ is being used, while importing the {initializeApp}, do import it from 'firebase/app',
and not just 'firebase'. Otherwise this will throw error the way it was throwing for the course staff demoing
the user authentication. Reference:
